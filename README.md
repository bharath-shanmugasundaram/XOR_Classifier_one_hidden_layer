# XOR Neural Network from Scratch (NumPy)

This repository implements a **two-layer neural network** in Python using **NumPy** to solve the XOR problem ‚Äî all from scratch.

---

## üìú Overview
The XOR problem is a classic example where a single-layer perceptron fails, but a multi-layer neural network can succeed.

**Architecture:**


**Features:**
- 1 hidden layer with 4 neurons
- Sigmoid activation
- Binary cross-entropy loss
- Gradient descent weight updates

## üß† XOR Truth Table
| X1 | X2 | Y |
|----|----|---|
| 0  | 0  | 0 |
| 0  | 1  | 1 |
| 1  | 0  | 1 |
| 1  | 1  | 0 |

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NumPy

If you put this as `README.md` in your repo, your GitHub visitors will:  
‚úÖ Understand the project  
‚úÖ Have the **full working code** in one place  
‚úÖ See **how to run it** and **sample output**  

Do you also want me to make this **README include a loss curve plot image** so it looks visually appealing on GitHub? That would make it look more professional.
